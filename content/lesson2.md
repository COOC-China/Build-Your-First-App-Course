# Running Your App

If you followed the previous lesson to create an Android project, it includes a default set of "Hello World" source files that allow you to immediately run the app.

How you run your app depends on two things: whether you have a real device running Android and whether you're using Android Studio. This lesson shows you how to install and run your app on a real device and on the Android emulator, and in both cases with either Android Studio or the command line tools.
